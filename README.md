Introduction

The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, organized by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. It provides a framework for understanding the relationships between the elements and predicting their behaviors.

History of the Periodic Table

1869: Dmitri Mendeleev published the first widely recognized periodic table, organizing elements by increasing atomic mass and predicting undiscovered elements.

1913: Henry Moseley rearranged the table by atomic number, solving inconsistencies in Mendeleev's table.

Modern Additions: Discovery of noble gases, synthetic elements, and the lanthanides/actinides completed the table.

Periodic Trends

Atomic Radius:

Decreases across a period (left to right).

Increases down a group.

Ionization Energy:

Increases across a period.

Decreases down a group.

Electronegativity:

Increases across a period.

Decreases down a group.

Electron Affinity:

Becomes more negative across a period.

Less negative down a group.

Mnemonics for Groups

Group 1 (Alkali Metals):
"LiNa Kills Ruby Cats Frantically" = Lithium, Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium, Cesium, Francium.

Group 17 (Halogens):
"Fiona Claps Bravely In Autumn" = Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, Astatine.

Block-wise Breakdown

s-block:

Groups 1-2.

Includes alkali and alkaline earth metals.

p-block:

Groups 13-18.

Contains nonmetals, metalloids, and noble gases.

d-block:

Transition metals (Groups 3-12).

f-block:

Lanthanides and actinides.

Applications

Hydrogen (H): Used in fuel cells and ammonia production.

Oxygen (O): Essential for respiration and industrial oxidation processes.

Silicon (Si): Basis for semiconductors in electronics.

Iron (Fe): Core material in construction and manufacturing.

Fun Facts

Helium was discovered in the Sun before it was found on Earth.

Francium is so rare that there is less than 1 ounce of it on Earth.

The only letter not appearing on the periodic table is "J."
